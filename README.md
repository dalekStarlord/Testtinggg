# Testtinggg

This project hosts the prototype map application for the Cagayan de Oro public transport planner.

## Deploying your changes

1. Make sure all work is committed locally:
   ```bash
   git status
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "Describe your change"
   ```
2. Set the remote if you have not already (replace the URL with your repository):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git
   ```
   If the remote already exists, verify it with:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
3. Push the committed changes to the remote branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```
4. For subsequent pushes after the upstream branch is set, simply run:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```
5. Create a pull request on your hosting platform (e.g., GitHub) to review and merge your changes.
